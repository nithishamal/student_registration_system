This assignment provided an opportunity to explore and apply the JavaScript knowledge gained. It was both challenging and enjoyable to work on. Through this assignment, I developed a better understanding of how to properly write and integrate JavaScript with HTML. With a few references from the internet, I was able to complete the assignment successfully, covering all the requirements and even adding some additional features.
